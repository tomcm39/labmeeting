# labmeeting

This code takes the members from the *lab-meeting* channel, generates the semester weeks from the UMASS academic calendar at "https://www.umass.edu/registrar/calendars/academic-calendar", and assigns members at random to present scientific research. Users can choose the semester to randomize and the lab meeting's day of the week (DOW).
